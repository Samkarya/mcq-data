        answer: "B. Analyzing the connectivity properties of the graph (connectedness, components).",
        explanation: " Since isolated vertices represent nodes that are not connected to the rest of the graph, identifying them helps us understand the overall connectivity of the graph. It can reveal whether the graph is connected (all nodes reachable from each other) or has disconnected components (isolated nodes or groups of nodes not connected to the main graph). Option A, C, and D might be indirectly related but don't directly utilize the information about isolated vertices."

        answer: "C. m >= n - v (usually true, but can have exceptions).",
        explanation: " While there's no single definitive formula, a relationship can be established between the number of nodes (n), edges (m), and isolated vertices (v) in a graph. Here's why option C is generally true:- Each edge connects two nodes.- If there are no isolated vertices (v = 0), then all n nodes must be connected by edges, and m would be close to its maximum possible value (n*(n-1)/2 for an undirected graph).- As the number of isolated vertices (v) increases, the number of edges (m) will likely decrease because isolated nodes don't contribute edges."

        explanation: " Depth-First Search (DFS) is a well-suited algorithm for finding the number of connected components in a graph. It can explore each connected component by starting from a node and recursively visiting its unvisited neighbors. The number of times DFS restarts the exploration from a new unvisited node corresponds to the number of connected components.

        explanation: " Highly connected graphs imply that there are many paths between nodes, allowing for shorter distances between them. This translates to a low diameter, which represents the shortest possible distance between the farthest two nodes in the graph. Option A is the opposite of a highly connected graph.

Here's why all options can be true:- Option A: Removing an edge in a dense graph (many edges) might not affect the overall connectivity if there are alternative paths between connected nodes.- Option B: Deleting an edge always reduces the degree of both connected nodes by 1 since they lose one connection.- Option C: If the edge being deleted is a bridge (connects two subgraphs), removing it can split the graph into disconnected components.- Option D combines these possibilities, highlighting that the impact of deletion depends on the graph's structure and the specific edge."

Their degrees are reduced by 1.- Edge contraction: Two nodes (u and v) are merged into a single node. Edges connected to u are redirected to v, and then u is removed. This effectively reduces the number of nodes and alters the graph structure.Option B is incorrect; contraction can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs. Option C focuses on a specific aspect of deletion but doesn't capture the merging aspect of contraction.

        answer: "B. If there exists a planar graph that requires more than four colors to ensure no adjacent regions share the same color.",
        explanation: " The Four Color Problem, finally proven in 1976, asks if four colors are sufficient to color any planar graph (a graph that can be drawn on a plane without edges intersecting) such that no adjacent regions share the same color. Options A, C, and D deal with other graph theory problems."

        answer: "C. Both theoretical and practical motivations.",

        answer: "B. It has (n-1) edges for every node.",
        explanation: " A complete graph K_n has an edge between every pair of distinct nodes. Since there are n nodes, each node will have connections to (n-1) other nodes. Option A overestimates the number of edges, while C and D are properties that may or may not hold true depending on the value of n. "

        explanation: " In a directed graph, edges have a direction. The in-degree of a node refers to the number of edges that point towards that node. Option A considers both incoming and outgoing edges. Option B refers to the out-degree, and option D involves the difference between these two values."

        explanation: " Two graphs are isomorphic if there exists a bijective function (one-to-one and onto) that maps nodes in one graph to nodes in the other, while also maintaining the edge connections between those nodes. Option A is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Options B and D describe non-isomorphic graphs."

        answer: "B. BFS prioritizes exploring all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.",
        explanation: " BFS explores a graph in a layer-by-layer fashion, visiting all neighbors of a node before proceeding to the next level. DFS, on the other hand, explores a single path as deeply as possible until it reaches a dead end, then backtracks and explores another path. Option A is not applicable for unweighted graphs. Option C is incorrect as both algorithms work for directed and undirected graphs. Option D partially describes the exploration strategies but doesn't capture the key difference."

        answer: "B. A subgraph of G that connects all nodes with the minimum total edge weight.",
        explanation: " A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of edges from the original graph that connects all nodes exactly once while minimizing the total weight of the edges in the tree. Option A focuses only on the number of edges, not their weight. Option C includes all edges, which might not be minimal. Option D describes a subgraph with only cycles, which is not a characteristic of MSTs. "

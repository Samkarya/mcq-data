        answer: "C. Move inactive pages to a dedicated disk partition.",
        explanation: " Swap space is a portion of the hard disk that acts as an extension of RAM. When physical RAM becomes full, the operating system temporarily moves inactive pages (data not actively being used) to the swap space to free up memory for active processes. This allows the system to continue running programs that wouldn't fit in RAM alone. Option A is incorrect as terminating the process is a last resort. Option B is not possible as swap space resides on the disk. Option D deals with memory compression, which is a different technique for managing memory usage."

        options: ['  Demand Paging', '  Partitioning', '  Segmentation', '  Virtual Memory'],
        answer: "B. Partitioning",
        explanation: " Partitioning is a simple approach where a dedicated section of the disk is allocated as swap space. This method has a fixed size and can be inefficient if memory usage patterns are unpredictable. Demand paging, on the other hand, allocates swap space dynamically as needed. Segmentation and virtual memory are broader concepts related to memory management, not specifically swap space allocation."

        answer: "C. Loads only the pages that are needed first.",
        explanation: " To minimize disk I/O overhead, the OS often employs a technique called 'demand paging' when swapping processes back in. It only loads the pages that are actively required by the process initially. Unused pages are loaded from swap space only when they are specifically accessed by the program."

        answer: "B. Simplified disk management.",
        explanation: " A dedicated swap partition simplifies disk management as it clearly defines the area reserved for swap operations.

        answer: "C. Least Recently Used (LRU)",
        explanation: " The LRU algorithm is a popular choice for swap space replacement. It prioritizes swapping out pages that haven't been used for the longest time. The assumption is that these pages are less likely to be needed soon, minimizing the chance of swapping them back in shortly after."

        answer: "A. Virtual memory is a concept, while swap space is a physical storage location.",
        explanation: " Virtual memory is a broader concept that allows a system to run programs larger than physical RAM by providing an illusion of more memory. Swap space, on the other hand, is a specific physical location on the disk used to store temporarily swapped-out pages from RAM. Virtual memory utilizes swap space as a part of its overall memory management strategy."

        answer: "C. To improve cache locality and data access patterns.",
        explanation: " Page sizes influence cache locality. Smaller page sizes can lead to better cache utilization by bringing frequently accessed data chunks together in the cache. This improves data access patterns as programs tend to access nearby memory locations."

        answer: "C. Only the program counter and registers are saved.",
        explanation: " During a context switch, the operating system needs to save the state of the previous process. This primarily involves saving the program counter (indicating the next instruction to execute) and the values in CPU registers. Loaded pages from the previous process might remain in memory for the next process to use if needed."

        options: [' Reduced internal fragmentation', ' Increased page table size', ' Improved cache utilization', ' Less overhead for page table management'],
        answer: "B. Increased page table size.",
        explanation: " While smaller page sizes offer benefits for cache locality, they also lead to a larger number of pages. This necessitates a larger page table to store the mapping information for all pages. A bigger page table consumes additional memory and can increase management overhead."

        answer: "C. Both A and B",
        explanation: " Reducing page faults improves demand paging performance. Increasing physical memory allows more pages to reside in memory, decreasing the need to access secondary storage.

        answer: "A. It uses a reference bit to identify recently usedpages.",
        explanation: " The Second Chance algorithm is an improvement over FIFO. Itutilizes a reference bit to track if a page has been used recently. When apage needs replacement, SC checks the reference bit. If it's 0 (not usedrecently), the page is evicted. If it's 1 (used recently), the bit iscleared, and the page gets a 'second chance' to stay. This helps avoidevicting recently used pages even if they were loaded earlier."

        answer: "C. Implementing efficient page replacement algorithms",
        explanation: " Page faults occur when a program tries to access a page thatis not currently in physical memory. Implementing a well-designed pagereplacement algorithm plays a crucial role in minimizing page faults.
